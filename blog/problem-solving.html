    <h1>A time when I: got blocked on a simple problem</h1>
        When attempting to solve multiple tests that form a "bigger picture" outcome/result.
            <div></div>
    <h1>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h1>
        Reaching this outcome in a staggered/sequential way, rather than trying to solve everything in one go. The result used a more direct and efficient application of code.

        <br>
    <h1>What was the problem?</h1>
        Constructing an object that contains various amounts of information and details.    

    <h1>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h1>
        First, always trying to be clear about what the actual problem is and what the error message means. Watching previous tutorials on a specific subject for a refresh. Searching up online, sometimes for basic definitions of a process/method. Attempting many techniques to solve the problem, even when referring to a sample solution i.e. not just immediately reproducing the solution.

        <br>
    <h1>How did you feel throughout the process?</h1>
        Determined to find a solution. Sometimes frustrated.

        <br>
    <h1>What did you learn?</h1>
        Multiple ways of solving a single problem.

    <h1>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h1>
        <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
        Need to spend more time practicing pseudocode. Haven't really tapped into its potential to help solve problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Trying something</strong>
        Even though I may not have the right idea initially, I/m comfortable trying other ideas even if they seem totally wrong or illogical at first.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
        Haven't really tried this method directly. Or I do use it, but less consciously. What I usually do is ask myself the key question rather than opening it up into an imaginary conversation and breaking it down which I can see as being quite useful.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
        Although I always try and pay attention to error messages, sometime's they can be cryptic or hard to understand or it feels like I only have a small crumb of information to figure out the problem. With practice and experience I would expect error messages to become much easier to understand and less confronting.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Console.logging</strong>
        Not confident with the function and purpose of cosole.logging. Yet. Need to do my own research around it and just play to start feeling comfortable with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Googling</strong>
        Almost always involve Google if I'm super stuck on something. So far I've found a few types of useful resources via Google such as: forums, technical glossaries, sites that allow you to test code and videos that demonstrate step by step guides that make it easy to follow as you try something out.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
        Sometimes I feel a bit shy or hesitant to ask for help. Slack has been really useful to reach out and get advice or even just observe similar problems others may be having and the advice received.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
        So far I've not really had to ask for help that much outside our weekly check in. Other than that, everything has been covered and sorted during the check in.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
        Need to spend more time actively improving my approach to coding outside the actual challenges or tests. One thing I have attempted to do is tidy up my code for previous blog posts as an extension of learning about it this week. Still getting my head around the rules and how to apply best practice.
