    <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
    
    To learn a new set of skills in this course that will help enable me to secure work in the tech world. To imagine interesting ways of combining these new skills with my existing abilities, ambitions and involvement in the art world. To meet new people from backgrounds different to my own. To continue working with other creative individuals such as artists but also those in the tech industry. The ability to work remotely when necessary, travel as I work and maintain flexible hours.

    <h1>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h1>
    
    My strengths include maintaining an open mind and healthy curiosity, patience/pacing myself, conscientiousness, efficiency, organisation and being resourceful. Limitations are probably all the opposites to what I have just listed or a type of technique or approach that I would find frustrating or confusing such as disorganisation or unreliability. I try not to take myself too seriously, remembering to have fun. I do take my work seriously.

    <h1>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
    
    The front-of-house work I have been doing for the last few years has usually been autonomous, so I’m looking forward to a change of scenery and some regularity working with others on a daily basis. At the moment, I’m thinking of it as a kind of open studio. This is an opportunity for me to work as part of a team in a new context and learn from others in the process.
    <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>

    Working productively requires a healthy balance between focus and positive distraction. This means giving myself time to breathe, even when under pressure, by making space for breaks and recreation. Even if it just means going for a walk or making something to eat. To be fully aware of the job at hand and what it will require ahead of time so that there is less room for miscommunication or misunderstanding between people. Be willing to help others if they need it or ask for it, especially under stressful circumstances.
    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h1>

    To try and not let an issue drag on and become heavy and difficult to deal with. To look for help in all the available channels and contact my facilitator as soon as possible if anything unexpected comes up or if I require extra time to complete something.
    <h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:
    </h1>

    To be reliable and helpful. To give constructive and critical feedback in a generous way or provide useful suggestions about how to solve problems. To be understanding, self-aware and enjoy having a laugh.
