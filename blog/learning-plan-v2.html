        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? What are you hoping to use
        the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
    </h1>
    
        Probably website design and construction. Could be any context. Conceptual impact. General application of new skills in a fine arts context.
        <div></div>
    <h1>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

        Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
    </h1>
    
        Nothing much has changed. I'd expect to have a new perspective after bootcamp has started, once I've met everyone and have a sense of the overall vibe.
        <br>
    <h1>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        While you will face many technical challenges in Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
    </h1>
        I'm just looking forward to working within a group of people who have a similar goal in mind.
    <h1>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving
        yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
    </h1>

        Getting back into group work on a daily basis after a long time of being relatively autonomous in the work place.
    <h1>
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?

        What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.
    </h1>

        To be reliable and helpful. To give constructive and critical feedback in a generous way or provide useful suggestions about how to solve problems. To be understanding, patient, self-aware and enjoy having a laugh.
    <h1>
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
    </h1>

        Similar to the previous answer (except from the perspective of a total coding novice). To be realistic and honest about what I can and can't deliver.

    <h1>
        Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a
        timely way?
    </h1>

        To keep in touch with everyone on a regular basis to establish familiarity and awareness of what work is expected and when it should be completed. To look ahead and make sure the expectations are realistic or personally achievable. If not, to let the right people know so that any issues can be resolved efficiently.
