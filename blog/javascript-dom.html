    <h1>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.
    </h1>
    
        HTML is the code that sets up a structure. Imagine this structure literally, as if you were building a house from the ground up. All the parts are there to construct the "bones" of the house i.e. the HTML. Let's imagine a timber frame construction. Like all the other timber frame houses on the street, when they were being built, this house will probably appear quite similar. Apart from the structure itself, you would probably think it's just another house.

        Now imagine you employ the services of an interior designer. This is the CSS. The designer is going to help you choose all the furniture, lighting, paint colours for the walls, tiles for the floor, kitchen appliances and even the cutlery. Like CSS, the designer will look carefully at all the details, and consider the "look and feel" of everything. This involves a lot of decision making and can take a long time to get right since there are also practical things to consider like how user-friendly the kitchen appliances are and how hard-wearing the bathroom floor is. The work of the interior designer is what will set the house apart from all the others on the street.

    <h1>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h1>
        The term control flow refers to the order in which a set of instructions in your programme are executed. A loop is something that will continue to repeat until a certain condition is met (i.e. until a certain condition becomes "true"). Say you are trying to reach a personal goal of 10,000 steps each day for a week. First you have a glass of water, then some toast for breakfast, another glass of water, put your trainers on and walk to the park. This is the control flow. You figure out that five complete circuits of the park plus the distance to and from home equals 10,000 steps. This is the loop.

    <h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
        The Document Object Model or "DOM" is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. An easy way to interact with the DOM is by using Developer Tools in Chrome. A kind of X-ray feature that allows you to see all the code used to create a web page. In addition to this high visibility, you can actively manipulate elements and objects by adjusting the code.

    <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from objects and arrays.</h1>
        Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. Basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called "properties" that consist of a "key" and a "value". Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation.

        Arrays are used to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. Arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. Items can be added and removed from the beginning or end of an array using the push(), pop(), unshift(), and shift() methods.

    <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
        A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure — a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
    <br>
    <br>
        A function is a set of statements designed to perform a particular task. Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function. Values can be passed into functions and used within the function. Functions should always return a value.
