  <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
    
      Maybe not learned, more reminded of. Don't like to feel blocked by a problem that seems impossible to solve. Not having the right expertise or knowledge to complete a task is frustrating. Patient and persistent in reaching a desired level of satisfaction/accomplishment.
  
  <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>

      Bit hard to say at this stage since I have only interacted with people remotely. My thinking is that this will become more apparent during bootcamp with face to face learning.   
    <br>
  
  <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
      
      After understanding the purpose of the core learning, the focus for me has been reflection and consideration.

  <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>

      Articulating thoughts that are not usually put into written words for a blog post.

  <h1>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>

      I would like to ask you that question (or several questions) and listen to the answer. eg Has the core learning been a part of the curriculum since the beginning? How do you assess the effectiveness of the core learning? Have you considered or implemented a sprint that is devoted entirely to the core learning?

  <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>

      I don't think it's been a waste of time but I do think it can really only reach its full potential if encouraged or discussed in person. Face to face. Otherwise it can seem a bit decorative, irrelevant or unnecessary.
