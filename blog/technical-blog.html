    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
      <p style="background-color:rgb(255, 217, 0);"> 
        In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content.
        Put another way, the margin property controls the space <span style="color:red">outside</span> an element, and the padding property controls the space <span style="color:red">inside</span> an element.
    <div></div>
      <strong>Exploring margins</strong><br>
              Consider the element illustrated below, which has a margin of 10 pixels:
        <br>
        <br>
    <image src="/blog/1.png" alt="Fig. 1">
        <br>
        <br>
              This means that there will be at least 10 pixels of space between this element and adjacent page elements — the margin <span style="color:red">pushes away</span> its neighbours. If we put multiples of these elements together, we see how margins create whitespace between them, giving them room to breathe:
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
              On the other hand, padding is located inside the border of an element. The element below has padding of 10px on the left and right sides, and padding of 15px on the top and bottom sides:
        <br>
    <image src="/blog/3.png" alt="Fig. 3">
        <br>
        <br>
              To create the gap, the padding either grows the element’s size or shrinks the content inside. By default, the size of the element increases. If you want to create the gap by shrinking the content, set the <span style="color:dodgerblue">box-sizing</span> property to <span style="color: dodgerblue;">border-box</span> (i.e. <span style="color: dodgerblue;">box-sizing: border-box</span>).
        <br>

      <strong>A helpful analogy</strong>
        <br>
    Imagine a set of framed and matted photographs hanging on a wall.
        <br>
        <br>
    Each photo is surrounded by a mat that puts space between the photo and the frame. That space would be the <strong>padding</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
    The frame encloses the mat and the image. That would be the <strong>border</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
    Each picture has a set amount of space around the outside. That is the <strong>margin</strong>. If two pictures are hanging side by side, with 10 cm between them, then we might say that they each have a 5 cm margin. The margin is the distance between an element and something else.

A kind of "X-ray vision" of any website, this helpful feature allows you to view the html and css used to create the site. You can also simulate changes by adjusting the code.
