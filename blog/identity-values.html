    <h1>Describe your core personal values</h1>
    
        People, peace and understanding, trust and most importantly, love.
    <div></div>
    <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h1>
    Rather than explain a particular situation, I will describe a part of my work experience that involves ethical decision making.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because I have experience working with and representing anonymous artists, there are often unusual obstacles to overcome that most people would probably not think twice about. My job is to protect these individuals and respect their approach without compromising their work or their beliefs. Having an anonymous identity often creates a challenge for certain individuals or organisations because something that is usually very straight forward, suddenly becomes complex. This could be as simple as filling out your legal name on a form, supplying your address, your date of birth, etc. An anonymous artist cannot provide these things! This sort of situation involves a lot of problem solving. The solution is almost always achieved by recruiting friends, family or a group of trusted individuals to help find the best possible solution. In my work with anonymous artists, we have confronted issues that ultimately exclude certain groups of people from participating in particular areas of professional work. Our challenge has been to find ethical but also imaginative ways to overcome these obstacles that ultimately benefit everyone.
    <br>
    <h1>How did you weigh up the values involved in making ethical decisions?</h1>
    
    We made sure that everyone’s integrity was intact and not jeopardised. When necessary we referred to the law and what is legal.
    <h1>What decisions did you make? What were the consequences of the actions you took?</h1>

    We considered things like equity, inclusion and the future i.e. thinking of others that may find themselves in a similar situation. The consequences of our actions could help others and even inspire people to create new approaches and techniques.
    <h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
    </h1>

    Not something I can answer quickly because it’s complex. To put it simply though, and so I’m not here, typing a novel: kinship, interconnectedness, a sense of belonging and extended family and the values mentioned above are central to the culture I have grown up with.
    <h1>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>

    My strengths include maintaining an open mind and healthy curiosity, patience/pacing myself, conscientiousness, efficiency, organisation, being resourceful. Limitations are probably all the opposites to these or a type of technique or approach that I would find frustrating or confusing such as disorganisation or unreliability.
    <h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h1>

    Probably all of them! They are useful reminders when obstacles seem impossible to overcome. For example, if I was to focus on efficiency, I would attempt to block out unnecessary distractions.
    <h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
    </h1>

    In my experience with difficult situations, positive encouragement is a helpful way to move forward as a group. These are some general ideas and strategies applicable to similarly difficult situations:
    <br>
    <br>
    Everyone has the potential to contribute
    <br>
    <br>
Let someone know about the good things they have done or continue to do
    <br>
    <br>
Incorporating patience and the willingness to listen
    <br>
    <br>
Allowing others to voice their opinions in their own time without being rushed
    <br>
    <br>
Not writing off what others have to say
    <br>
    <br>
Asking questions to open up the conversation instead of closing it down
    <br>
    <br>
Putting your ego aside for one second
    <br>
    <br>
Learn to embrace what you don’t understand
    <br>
    <br>
Be willing to experiment outside your comfort zone for a good cause
    <br>
    <br>
Think carefully about finding potential where others may have overlooked it
