    <h1>Describe your core personal values</h1>
    
        People, peace and understanding, trust and most importantly, love.
    <div></div>

    <h1>How did you weigh up the values involved in making ethical decisions?</h1>
    
        We made sure that everyone’s integrity was intact and not jeopardised. When necessary we referred to the law and what is legal.
    <h1>What decisions did you make? What were the consequences of the actions you took?</h1>

        We considered things like equity, inclusion and the future i.e. thinking of others that may find themselves in a similar situation. The consequences of our actions could help others and even inspire people to create new approaches and techniques.
    <h1>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h1>

        To put it simply: kinship, interconnectedness, a sense of belonging and extended family and the values mentioned above are central to the culture I have grown up with.
    <h1>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>

        My strengths include maintaining an open mind and healthy curiosity, patience/pacing myself, conscientiousness, efficiency, organisation, being resourceful. Limitations are probably all the opposites to these or a type of technique or approach that I would find frustrating or confusing such as disorganisation or unreliability.
    <h1>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h1>

        Probably all of them! They are useful reminders when obstacles seem impossible to overcome. For example, if I was to focus on efficiency, I would attempt to block out unnecessary distractions.
    <h1>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
    </h1>

        In my experience with difficult situations, positive encouragement is a helpful way to move forward as a group. These are some general ideas and strategies applicable to similarly difficult situations:
    <br>
    <br>
        Everyone has the potential to contribute
    <br>
    <br>
        Let someone know about the good things they have done or continue to do
    <br>
    <br>
        Incorporating patience and the willingness to listen
    <br>
    <br>
        Allowing others to voice their opinions in their own time without being rushed
    <br>
    <br>
        Not writing off what others have to say
    <br>
    <br>
        Asking questions to open up the conversation instead of closing it down
    <br>
    <br>
        Putting your ego aside for one second
    <br>
    <br>
        Learn to embrace what you don’t understand
    <br>
    <br>
        Be willing to experiment outside your comfort zone for a good cause
    <br>
    <br>
        Think carefully about finding potential where others may have overlooked it
