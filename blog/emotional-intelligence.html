    <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </h1>
    
    EQ centres self-awareness in relationship to yourself and others. Maintaining a good EQ requires the understanding of a person and their situation without judging them. The ability to make sense of someone else's position requires things like patience, understanding, empathy, foresight and knowing how and when to ask questions or take action.

    <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
    EQ represents things like potential, reflection, flexibility, adjustment, imagination, empathy, humour, creativity, self-awareness. Your IQ is a much more fixed representation of your abilities outside the realm of social interaction. Your IQ doesn't really require the participation of other people to work sufficiently whereas your EQ depends on others for it to matter. The concept of learning in relation to your EQ is a shared experience rather than an autonomous one. Your EQ can only be developed with the help of other people. Your IQ is something less flexible and could even be hierarchical/exclusive in some situations. There should be no competition with EQ. Equality is a good word to use in relation to EQ since.

    <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
    Maintaining or developing a good EQ is good for everyone. It can help you relate to anyone at anytime, not just for certain occasions. EQ promotes the removal of self-importance, ego, judgement or other things that may get in they way of understanding others and why people feel a certain way. Your EQ is what helps you grow and develop meaningful relationships or even just a fleeting encounter with someone. If you have a healthy EQ, it should be shared with others so that their EQ can also grow and develop. Imagine your EQ is a garden. Without lots of water, care and attention (removing weeds), patience and imagination (your aspirations), you can't expect it to grow.
